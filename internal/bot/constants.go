If you make profit we will automatically calculate the profit you have made and based on that the fee will be calculated.\n\n***Spot Market***\nFor the spot market the profit calculation will be a little bit different. We connect your account to our trading network using your binance read only api access.The calculation for the spot market will be: (SellPrice-EntryPrice)/EntryPrice . We also add 10% dust trades in your behaviour.This means the profit e.g from cornix does not match the profit inside your report, actually the profit in our report will be less than inside cornix and binance.\n\n***Payments and Report***\nWe have a fixed trading flat fee of 15%, this means we calculate the fees for each trade which is closed only with profit on your account. A report will be send out weekly where you can get a summary of all the fees and a payment link to binance pay.The link will be available for one hour, if you miss the payment window you simple can re-create a new one. If we have not recived the payment within 72 hours your account will be permantnly locked from our network.\n\n***Help***\nIf you have questions regarding your payment please send us a message to: billing@cashways.ai including your telegram username and license key.\n\n***Multiple Trades*** It is highly recommend that you do not execute trades manually on the same binance account with the same symbols.If you do this can led to double collected fees."
